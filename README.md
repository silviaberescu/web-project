# Todo Application 

## Overview

This is a Todo application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to manage their tasks with functionalities to add, edit, mark as complete, and filter tasks based on their status. The tasks are persisted in the browser's local storage, so they remain available even after refreshing the page.

- Add Tasks: Enter a task in the input field and click "Add" or press Enter to add it to your todo list.
- Edit Tasks: Click on a task to edit it directly.
- Toggle Task Status: Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox next to each task.
- Filter Tasks: Use the "All", "Active", and "Completed" buttons to filter tasks by their status.
- Clear Completed Tasks: Remove all completed tasks from the list.
